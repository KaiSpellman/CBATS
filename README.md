Cloud-Based Algorithmic Trading Strategies for Individual Investors

## Description
Effective investing strategies have historically been exclusive to professional investors and the wealthy, leaving lower and middle-class individuals with limited options for managing their investments. These groups, who could benefit most from advanced strategies, often lack access to the tools and knowledge necessary for optimizing returns while managing risk. The emergence of cloud-based platforms presents an opportunity to democratize algorithmic trading by making sophisticated strategies, such as the barbell approach, available to individual investors. The Cloud-Based Algorithmic Trading Strategies for Individual Investors project aims to develop an accessible solution for both manual and automated trading, allowing users to maximize profits while minimizing drawdown, regardless of their trading frequency or financial expertise. By leveling the playing field, we empower a broader audience to make informed investment decisions and take control of their financial futures. 

This project is under NDA so there are limited details I can share about the product itself, instead I will focus on the technologies I personally used.
